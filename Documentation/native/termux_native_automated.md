## Installtation Steps <a name=termux-auto-install></a>
Run the following commands in Termux:
```
pkg update
pkg upgrade -y
pkg install -y wget
```
Download TCM's automated setup script:
```
cd ~
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Prime-TITAN-CameraMan/termux-desktops/refs/heads/main/Scripts/termux_native/termux_native_xfce4_setup.sh
```
I'm not sure, what's the line break of the script. So, it's safe & necessary to Install `dos2unix` and convert the script for Linux line break.
```
pkg install -y dos2unix
dos2unix termux_native_xfce4_setup.sh
```
Give executive permission to the script:
```
chmod +x termux_native_xfce4_setup.sh
```
Run the script:
```
bash ~/termux_native_xfce4_setup.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> This installation will take some time. So, be patience. Also it'll promt to enter keyboard layout and your desired browser. So, make sure not to go AFK.

> [!WARNING]
> the desktop environment can cause slight screen tearing as the V-Sync in turned off, while the tearing is minimal or unnoticable if you've a moderate-good GPU
